# Decision_Tree_Project
This will have the project which I have worked using the Decision Tree Algorithm.


## Titanic Data Set
1. RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912.

2. On April 15, 1912 the Titanic sank, costing the lives of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

3. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, causing a disproportionate number of deaths.

T4. he reason behind sinking of this beauty was because of striking to an iceberg while travelling from Southampton to New York City.

5. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

2. Problem Statement
RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912.

On April 15, 1912 the Titanic sank, costing the lives of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, causing a disproportionate number of deaths.

The reason behind sinking of this beauty was because of striking to an iceberg while travelling from Southampton to New York City.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.



**Scenario**
One of the most popular disasters in the history is the sinking of the RMS Titanic.
Let's say, after the accident, there is a need to implement better regulations for passenger liners.

As a part of a data science team, you have been tasked with analyzing the passenger data of the RMS Titanic.

You have been provided with the data that contains the information about the passengers aboarded the ship.

The purpose is to analyze and explore factors that can influence a person’s likelihood to survive.

So, the primary objectives are to:

Do a statistical analysis of how some group of people were survived more than others.

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis of titanic dataset with visualizations and storytelling.



## Bank Loan Paid or Not:

Exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com.

Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).

Try to create a model that will help predict people who have a profile of having a high probability of paying back.

Lending club had a very interesting year in 2016.

This data is from before they even went public.
